Cost of buying the machine :$110,000
Down payment for lease : $25000
Monthly maintenance if bought : $900
Cost of leasing per month : $3500
For 31 months of machine operation the leasing cost is = Down payment + Total leasing cost
						       = Down payment + (Total amount of months * leasing cost per month)
						       = 25000+ [31*3500]=$133500
As the cost of leasing for 31 months is very close to the cost of buying, the alternative is to lease and 31 is the number of months to justify the buying choice 





Cost Analysis for Machine Purchase vs Lease

Cost of buying the machine: $110,000
Down payment for lease: $25,000
Monthly maintenance cost if bought: $900
Leasing cost per month: $3,500

Calculation:
Total leasing cost for 31 months of machine operation:
Down payment + (Total amount of months * leasing cost per month)
Down payment + Total leasing cost = $25,000 + (31 x $3,500) = $133,500

Conclusion:
After analyzing the cost of buying and leasing the machine, it has been determined that the total leasing cost for 31 months of machine operation is very close to the cost of buying. Therefore, it is recommended to lease the machine instead of buying, and 31 months is the number of months required to justify the buying choice.
